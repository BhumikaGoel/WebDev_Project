# WebDev_Project_July2016

I created this registration form in high school, when I was learning web development languages from an external institute, out of interest. 

This registration form (StudentForm0.php) is to be used to sign up for courses at this institute, where a potential student must provide some vital information. 
S/he must upload her/his picture in this form, and I have used PHP (StudentFormImgCode.php) to send the picture to a database (preciously created on the server,
i.e. my MacBook). Ajax (StudentForm0.php) is used to create a dynamic webpage whereby the picture is also displayed in the picture slot instantaneously. 

When the student signs up for courses of her/his choice, he is asked to verify the entered information, a mandatory field, upon which s/he 
clicks Submit. "Submit" asks for a confirmation, displaying error if the required fields are not filled in.

The first webpage redirects to the second webpage(StudentForm1.php), where the server looks up the course cost for every course selected by the student in a
previously created database for the purpose. It displays the total cost, and allows option for fee to be paid in installments. Upon suitable choice submission, 
the last webpage(End_Page.html) thanks the student for her/his interest in the course.

All the backend manipulation of database is enclosed in StudentForm0_php.php and StudentForm1_php.php. w3css.css and w3css1.css is used for styling the webpages.

My main areas of interest, as an undergraduate in Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley, are in Backend Engineering, Machine Learning and Data Science.
